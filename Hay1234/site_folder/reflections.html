<h2>
In autumn quarter 2018, I completed <em> Web Development I</em> at Edmonds Community College with Professor Louis Ho.<br/>
This class has provided me with a greater knowledge and understanding of web development. The subject context has<br/>
 prepared me for future academics in CIS.I began this course with really no competence in how to design, develop or <br/>
 validated web page. This course has taught me skills I will take with me to my future courses.<br/>
 <br/>
The result of this course has been unsurprisingly positive, as I enjoy being able to learn in a variety of different ways.<br/>
The CIW site has really made concept clear through a variety of different ways, because of this it has help me to challenge <br/>
myself to learn the materials deeply. Overall, I feel that this CIW has helped me to understand the material better. <br/>
At the conclusion of this class, I feel like Web Development is an area of computer science that I enjoy. I want to continue<br/>
 taking classes in web design and continue to grow and expand my knowledge. <br/>
 <br/>
Challenges I came across during the quarter was time management, I have full time school schedule and work part time as well,<br/> 
it was difficult at time to juggle all these schedules. Despite all my commitments, through the quarter I made sure that I set<br/>
 aside time to work on course work to ensure that I completed assignment by the deadlines.<br/>
<br/>
Another challenge is I have not taken many online courses, so it was different then Iâ€™m use to. Overall it was a good experience<br/>
 and it did not hinder my understanding of the material. It did give me the opportunity to independently learn the material.<br/>
 This challenged me and made me learn more because I did not have the security of the teacher to make teach me the material. <br/>
tried harder to learn the material on my own. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward im excited to learn more about web develepment and design.
